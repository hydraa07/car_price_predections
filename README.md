Car Price Prediction Project

Developed a predictive model to estimate car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, engine size, and fuel type.
Utilized Python for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
Applied machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to improve prediction accuracy.
Analyzed model performance using evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
Visualized data insights and model results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
